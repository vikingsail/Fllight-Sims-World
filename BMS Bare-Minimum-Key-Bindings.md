# Absolute Bare Minimum Keyfile for Falcon BMS #

*A one-page-cheat-sheet for pilots absolutely new to Falcon BMS*

The BMS-Minimum.key file contains almost 500 keyboard command bindings -- that's way too much to digest, to get started working through the training missions.

Do you really need to memorize hundreds of keyboard commands, to fly the F-16?  No.  Taxi, takeoff, basic flight and navigation, comms, landing, even employing basic AA and AG weapons -- it's a lot to learn, but most of what you need can be accessed by clicking buttons and switches in the virtual cockpit, when needed.

Learning what those systems are, and how they work, is hard enough in itself -- you shouldn't have to memorize hundreds of arbitrary keyboard bindings that real pilots don't!

The good news is, the list of things for which you really *need* to know the keyboard shortcut (or know the button on your stick or throttle) is pretty short -- it's just about 20 things.  Even that can be broken down further, to just begin with basic flying skills (no weapons or countermeasures) or, alternatively, jump into instant-action dogfighting (no takeoff/landing/taxiing).

- Bucket 1: basic flight, taxi/takeoff/navigate/land
- Bucket 2: acquire targets, shoot weapons, defend yourself
- Bucket 3: helpful to know / quality of life features

Again, these are just the things that either (a) don't have an accessible button or knob in the cockpit, or (b) need to be activated quickly, without taking eyes off the bad guy (or the runway).  Obviously, this is not the sum total of things you need to know and learn, to fly, fight and survive in the Viper.  But it's sufficient to jump into the training missions and begin the long process of learnings the F-16 cockpit and avionics.

Final note: the list below is for standard "qwerty" US keyboard layout.  Other keyboard layouts may vary -- eg. for DE keyboards, the [/] key is the [-] to the left of the righthand [shift] key.  If you have a fancy ergonomic keyboard, or use a Dvorak layout, you're on your own.
